    "Download and Extract ZIP File Script\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script allows you to download a ZIP file from a given URL and extract its contents into a new folder. \n",
    "The script creates a new directory with the name of the downloaded ZIP file inside the specified location and downloads the ZIP file to this folder. \n",
    "After that, it extracts the contents of the ZIP file inside the same folder and removes the downloaded ZIP file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "1. Replace the \"file_url\" variable with the URL of the ZIP file you want to download.\n",
    "2. Set the \"extraction_folder\" variable to the desired location where you want to save and extract the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "- This script requires the \"requests\" library, which you can install using \"pip install requests\".\n",
    "- The downloaded ZIP file will have the same name as in the URL and will be removed after extraction.\n",
    "- The folder name for extraction will be \"GLASS-GLC\". If you want a different name, modify the \"extraction_folder\" variable accordingly.\n",
